# GC pauses

When an allocation pattern keeps the GC busy, the GC thread
competes for CPU with the UI thread and ART's stop-the-world
points pause every running thread. Both effects show up in the
trace as red frames and visible `Background concurrent mark
compact GC` slices.

This is part of the
[Android performance tutorials](perf-tutorial-series.md) series.

## Capture

```
atrace_categories: "dalvik"  "view"  "sched"
atrace_apps: "com.example.perfetto.gc"

data_sources: { config { name: "android.surfaceflinger.frametimeline" } }
```

`dalvik` is what surfaces ART's GC slices. The frametimeline data
source pairs the GC pressure with frame outcomes so you can see
the consequence.

Full config:
[`trace-configs/gc.cfg`](https://github.com/fiveapplesonthetable/perfetto/tree/perf-tutorials-artifacts/gc-pauses/trace-configs/gc.cfg).

## Case study: `String + char` in a hot loop

Every 16 ms the demo builds a 10,003-character string by
concatenation:

```java
String s = "log";
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    s = s + (char) ('A' + (i % 26));   // each + allocates a new String
}
```

10,000 short-lived `String`s per call, called 60 times per second.
ART's allocator and GC quietly burn through the budget.

### Find it

```sql
SELECT 'avg_ms:'||(AVG(dur)/1e6)||' count:'||COUNT(*)
FROM slice WHERE name='buildLogLine';
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM slice
WHERE name LIKE '%GC%' AND name NOT LIKE '%Manager%'
  AND track_id IN (SELECT id FROM thread_track WHERE utid IN
      (SELECT utid FROM thread WHERE upid =
          (SELECT upid FROM process WHERE name='com.example.perfetto.gc')))
GROUP BY name;
```

Before-trace: **30 buildLogLine calls, 236.9 ms each (!), 259 GC
slices** (`Background concurrent mark compact GC` and
`Background young concurrent mark compact GC`). The hot loop is
generating so much garbage that the GC thread is permanently
busy.

![Buggy GC trace zoomed onto a `buildLogLine` slice. The slice itself runs ~237 ms; above and below, the GC daemon thread track is densely populated with concurrent mark-compact slices — the heap is constantly being collected.](../images/gc-pauses/before.png)

### Fix

One reusable `StringBuilder`. Same logic, no per-character
allocation:

```java
private final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(10003);

sb.setLength(0);
sb.append("log");
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    sb.append((char) ('A' + (i % 26)));
}
```

### Verify

After-trace: **449 buildLogLine calls, 0.80 ms each, 0 GC
slices** in the captured 6 s window. **295× faster per call,
15× more throughput, and the GC stops running entirely.**

![Fixed GC trace zoomed onto a `buildLogLine` slice. The slice is now ~0.8 ms; the GC daemon thread track is empty for the whole window — no allocations means no collections.](../images/gc-pauses/after.png)

## Second pattern: autoboxing pressure

Boxing an `int` into `Integer` in a hot loop has the same shape
in the trace — sustained background GC, allocation rate spike.
Different culprit (`Integer.valueOf`), same fix idea
(primitive collections, `Int*` boxes from
`androidx.collection`).

This pairs with the
[Java heap allocations](java-heap-allocations.md) tutorial: that
one shows the *what* (allocation flamegraph); this one shows the
*so-what* (GC frequency and pauses).
